    abstract = "{Compared with proteins, DNA and RNA are more difficult languages to interpret because four-letter coded DNA/RNA sequences have less information content than 20-letter coded protein sequences. While BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)-like language models have been developed for RNA, they are ineffective at capturing the evolutionary information from homologous sequences becauseĀ unlike proteins, RNA sequences are less conserved. Here, we have developed an unsupervised multiple sequence alignment-based RNA language model (RNA-MSM) by utilizing homologous sequences from an automatic pipeline, RNAcmap, as it can provide significantly more homologous sequences than manually annotated Rfam. We demonstrate that the resulting unsupervised, two-dimensional attention maps and one-dimensional embeddings from RNA-MSM contain structural information. In fact, they can be directly mapped with high accuracy to 2D base pairing probabilities and 1D solvent accessibilities, respectively. Further fine-tuning led to significantly improved performance on these two downstream tasks compared with existing state-of-the-art techniques including SPOT-RNA2 and RNAsnap2. By comparison, RNA-FM, a BERT-based RNA language model, performs worse than one-hot encoding with its embedding in base pair and solvent-accessible surface area prediction. We anticipate that the pre-trained RNA-MSM model can be fine-tuned on many other tasks related to RNA structure and function.}",
